Elon Muschioso is a Telegram bot that you can use to manage your computer from the phone.

# what does it do?
Elon Muschio makes a connection from your phone to your computer using Google's APIs and Telegram. Writing messages and commands to the bot in Telegram, from the phone or from other devices, you can easily manage your computer from the distance.

# setup
First of all, you must download Telegram and search the bot called "elonbot" or "ElonMuschiosoBot", so start it. You won't recieve any message, because the bot works only when it is running in your pc. So search "IDBot" and start it, then write the command '/getid' and copy the ID somewhere. Go to the settings and copy the username. After you did that, download Python and the files "Elon-1.0.py" and "Launch-Elon1.0.py". Open the Python IDLE and modify "Elon-1.0.py". In line 22 delete 000000000 and write there your ID (without question marks), and in line 24 change YOURUSERNAME in your username (you MUST use the QUOTATION MARKS at the beginning and at the end of the username). In line 144, change 000000000 with your ID, again. Then you can try to run the program: the bot will send you a message and you can use commands to use it.

# list of commands

# other things
You have to download the ZIP folder and you must NOT delete the subfolders, even if they don't contain any file: they are used when you call some functions (i.e. Camera, Screenshot, Password, etc.). To use the Password function, the program uses a software that shows saved passwords. Your antivirus may say it is a virus, but it is not.


If you want the program runs every time you turn on your computer, take the file 'Launch-Elon1.0.py' and place into th directory 'C:\Users\YOURPCUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup', writing your pc username where written YOURPCUSERNAME. Doing that, program will start every time you use your computer, so that you can manage it every time you want.
